# AIRlINER
RNA editing is a post-transcriptional alteration of RNA sequences that is able to affect protein structure as well as RNA and protein expression. A-to-I (Adenosine-to-Inosine) RNA editing is the most frequent and common post-transcriptional modification in human, where adenosine (A) deamination produces its conversion into inosine (I), which in turn is interpreted by the translation and splicing machineries as guanosine (G).

AIRlINER is an algorithmic approach to the assessment of A-to-I RNA editing sites in non-repetitive regions.
It determines the editing probability of an adenosine by analyzing its flanking region of 10 nucleotides. Such pattern is then combined with a similar model calculated from un-edited sequences, resulting in the estimation of an unbiased editing probability.
